      <description>Introduction This will be a quick short blog entry. Today I needed to have a container that could self-initialize it&amp;rsquo;s own Physical Volumes. This is quite easy to do with an init container. I&amp;rsquo;m going to provide a simple example to show how this works with busybox.
Deployment YAML initContainers: - name: init-pv image: {{ .Values.initpv.image }} volumeMounts: - name: init mountPath: {{ .Values.persistentVolume.path }} {{- with .Values.initpv.command }} command: {{- toYaml .</description>

      <description>Introduction This will be a quick short blog entry. Today I had an image running on Kubernetes from a vender invoked through HELM, and I needed to run some arbtirary commands however I did not want to extend the image and have to deal with maintaining yet another image. Below is the solution I came up with.
YAML to inject commands before entry point. image: repository: docker.io/user/image pullPolicy: IfNotPresent tag: &amp;#34;latest&amp;#34; command: - bash - &amp;#34;-c&amp;#34; - | sed -i &amp;#39;s/^param=.</description>

      <guid>https://www.nathanobert.com/posts/mac-cli-colors/</guid>
      <description>Changing colors in Terminal I utilize Command Line Interfaces (CLI) frequently, Linux, Unix, Mac etc. Small adjustments to the CLI can make huge impacts on my workflow. Readability of the screen is very important, and I personally prefer a slightly higher contrast display. What I mean by that is on a bright background I prefer dark foreground colors, and on a dark background I prefer bright foreground colors. Unfortuantly the out of the box configuration does not always allow that.</description>

      <description>Introduction This will be a quick short blog entry. Today I had an container running Oracle at Amazon EC2 on Kubernetes. I was trying to work thorugh some Pl/SQL code in sqlplus, and decided I wanted to instead use SQL Developer. After a little research this is what I came up with, and wanted to share it.
Bash Script kubectl patch svc oracle -p &amp;#39;{&amp;#34;spec&amp;#34;:{&amp;#34;externalIPs&amp;#34;:[&amp;#34;1.2.3.4&amp;#34;]}}&amp;#39; Basically you pass the kubernetes service name, as well as your ip address of the host (in this example 1.</description>

      <description>SSH Keep Alive Secure Shell is a means to connect terminals to servers. When it detects you are idle it disconnects you. This is for security. This however is very annoying and can cause issues if you are installing something and need to keep the terminal active. Some people try to leave &amp;rsquo;top&amp;rsquo; running or &amp;lsquo;screen&amp;rsquo; to keep the terminal busy. There is a simple configuration that can just as easily do this.</description>

      <guid>https://www.nathanobert.com/posts/blog-bash-colors/</guid>
      <description>Changing colors in BASH So I find some color combations very hard to read. If you have a black background, the dark blue directory color is hard to read. If you have a white background the bright green executable color is hard to read. For whatever reason it was not thought very well through to have well contrasting colors for everything. I found this Ask Ubunutu on how to change the directory colors and decided to write a blog post to make sure I never lost the steps again.</description>

      <title>GitHub Actions to automatically build Docker and push to registry</title>

      <description>Introduction GitHub provies &amp;ldquo;Actions&amp;rdquo; which are automatic actions that are ran on gitHub for you. This can be used to compile your code, compile your docker image, or do any arbitrary set of commands. This typically is done in software development to automatically push software between development and test. This is typically done to insure all the necessary code, configurations, etc necessary are checked into the source repository. Additionally this insures all the neccessary steps are done uniformly no matter which developer checks in the code.</description>

      <guid>https://www.nathanobert.com/posts/blog-init-container-check-service/</guid>
      <description>Introduction With HELM Scripts containers all try to start at the same time. It depends on how the containers scripts were designed on if there is any sort of delay or dependency cchecking built into them. I wrote a very simple busybox script that can be used to prevent a container from starting until the kubernetes services is needs are available.
In this example there are 3 checks going on.</description>

      <description>Introduction &amp;ldquo;Helm is the best way to find, share, and use software built for Kubernetes.&amp;rdquo; Kubernetes is a great container orchistration tool, however managing all the yaml files associated with it become a huge undertaking. Helm is a tool that allows you to create templates for Kubernetes yaml files. Then you only have to manage a set a value pairs that are passed to your templates. This allows you to easily share packages of templates, and other people can easily bring your containers online only having to modify the values to match their needs to customize or configure.</description>
