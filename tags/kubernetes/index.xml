      <description>Introduction GitHub provies &amp;ldquo;Actions&amp;rdquo; which are automatic actions that are ran on gitHub for you. This can be used to compile your code, compile your docker image, or do any arbitrary set of commands. This typically is done in software development to automatically push software between development and test. This is typically done to insure all the necessary code, configurations, etc necessary are checked into the source repository. Additionally this insures all the neccessary steps are done uniformly no matter which developer checks in the code.</description>

      <description>Introduction With HELM Scripts containers all try to start at the same time. It depends on how the containers scripts were designed on if there is any sort of delay or dependency cchecking built into them. I wrote a very simple busybox script that can be used to prevent a container from starting until the kubernetes services is needs are available.
In this example there are 3 checks going on.</description>

      <description>Introduction &amp;ldquo;Helm is the best way to find, share, and use software built for Kubernetes.&amp;rdquo; Kubernetes is a great container orchistration tool, however managing all the yaml files associated with it become a huge undertaking. Helm is a tool that allows you to create templates for Kubernetes yaml files. Then you only have to manage a set a value pairs that are passed to your templates. This allows you to easily share packages of templates, and other people can easily bring your containers online only having to modify the values to match their needs to customize or configure.</description>
