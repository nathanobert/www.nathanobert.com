      <description>Introduction Amazon Workspace is a hosted Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI). Amazon hosts your workstations in the cloud. Users can connect to their provisioned workstations through a client software provided by Amazon for many different platforms, including mobile. The key difference comparing this to EC2 instances, is the client software. With EC2 typically you use Remote Desktop Protocal (RDP) or Secure Shell (SSH). With Amazon Workspace utilize PCoIP or WSP. Both protocals work far superior for end user experience for responsivness, espically on lower speed networks.</description>
